Abstraction is a process that hides implementation details
and shows only functionality to the user.
Abstract classes:
1)Abstarct classes in java are classes with abstract keyword.
2)We use abstarct classes when we are sure about method header but not implementation.
3)We can declare a class as abstract class without having any extra methods inside it.
4) Once we have at least one abstract method we must declare that class as abstract.
5) We can have non-abstract methods as well inside the abstract class.
6) We need a child class to provide implementation of abstract methods.
7) The child class class provide the implementation for all the methods
or it can leave some methods unimplemented.
8) we can't have a class or method final and abstract at the same time.
9) we can't use abstract keyword with fields and constructors.
10) Abstarct methods don't have body in the parent class.
11) Abstract is a non-access modifier.
