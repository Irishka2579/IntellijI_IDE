RULES FOR CASTING OBJECTS/CLASSES
1)We can store a child class object inside a parent type variable
because inheritance is one way from Parent to child.
2)We can create arrays of type Parent and can store all
the child classes inside the array
3)we can't store/cast a parent class object to child
FinalKeyWord:
if we write final with variable we can't change its value either
we should initialize it right away or thorough the constructor.
When used with method we can't override
