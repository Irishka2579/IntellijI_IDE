Abstract class:
They are classes with the abstract keyword that we use when
we are not sure how to implement the some or all methods.

Rules:
1)Must participate in inheritance otherwise we will not be able
to use any instance methods or fields.
2)Abstract class can have 0 or any number of abstract methods
3)As soon as one method is declared abstract, the class needs to be declared as abstract
4)We can have non-abstract  methods as well inside the abstract
5)Abstract keyword connot be used with fields and constructor
6)Abstract keyword cannot be used with fields and constructor
7)We need a child class to provide implementations of abstract methods
8)When we extend an abstract class we must either provide the implementation
