Overriding:
Overriding happens when same methods exist in parents and child class.
Benefits:
we can have specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the Parent class.
Tha we have this flexibility that we don't have to come up with different names
if we are doing same thing again in the child classes.
Rules:
1) We can change the access modifier in child class but we can make it
only less restrictive for example we can change protected or default to public
but we can't do reverse.
2) static methods have the same rules but we use a diffeerent terminology
we say we are re-declaring a method instead of overriding
3)return types must be same in overriding
4)name must be same
5)parameters shoild also be the same
